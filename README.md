bzork
=====

Z-machine interpreter for your browser.

Using this project as a way of trying out the new JS T/BDD libraries, which
have always been the primary source of annoyance when working with JS projects
in the past. Jasmine looks nice, tho.

Primary goal is just to see the mailbox, for now. That will take quite a while.
Zork 1 is most readily available as a .z3, so I'm primarily aiming to support those first.
