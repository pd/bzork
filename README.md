bzork
=====

Z-machine interpreter for your browser.

Unless I get less lazy and essentially reimplement all of the ArrayBuffer/DataView
code which is available in Firefox4+ and Chrome9+ (or find someone who's done it
for me), this will only work in those browsers. I am more concerned with playing
around with the code than I am with anyone else ever playing around with the game.

Primary goal is just to see the mailbox, for now. That will take quite a while.
Zork 1 is most readily available as a .z3, so I'm primarily aiming to support those first.
